Team name:- patronus

Theme:- 
THEME 1 :- A BETTER SEARCH ENGINE FOR EDUCATION

Idea:- 
Make a search engine which would get exact results from a video by reading the contents from video description, subtitles and comments


How will you solve the problem? (280 characters)

Our goal is to build a website which will allow any user to search their query which will in turn will show answers to their questions in the form of videos. We will do this by using APIs of the resulting videos via subtitles, comments and/or matching relevant description to check and identify the correct solution to the question from a certain timestamp of the video.

What will be your final demo? (280 characters)

Our final demo will include a full hands on working prototype which we will showcase in a video listed on YouTube for everyone to view.We want to build a web application that let's anyone from anyone search anything they want. The backend will check the comment,subtitle and more on and then from that query we will be able to determine what their specific needs are.We want to build a web application that lets anyone from anywhere search anything they want. The backend will check the comment,subtitle and more on and then from that query we will be able to determine what their specific needs are.It would showcase the inner workings of our model, a small presentation from ideation to the prototype phase. Our hope is to give our model the light of the day.
